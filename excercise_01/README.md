# excercise 01

### Task 1:
Write a program that reads string (endpoint) from command line and uses this
to connect to Malamute broker.

First, assert is used and we try to feed in existing mlm endpoint as well as
nonexisting one. See what happens.

### Task 2: 
try to exit with `zsys_error` and a bit of grace :)
